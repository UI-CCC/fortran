#   Fortran for Engineers

This module presumes some level of background programming experience on the part of the student.  It focuses more on how concepts are implemented and used in a given language than on fundamental computer-scientific or information-theoretic ideas.

The reference Fortran should be 95, with notes on legacy or newer versions made as necessary.
